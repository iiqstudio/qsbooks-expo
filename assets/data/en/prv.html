<h2 id="prv-ch-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-2">To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-3">To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; {equity: Heb. equities}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-4">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. {discretion: or, advisement}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-5">A wise {man} will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-6">To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. {the interpretation: or, an eloquent speech}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-7">The fear of the LORD {is} the beginning of knowledge: {but} fools despise wisdom and instruction. {the beginning: or, the principal part}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-8">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-9">For they {shall be} an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. {an...: Heb. an adding}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-11">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-12">Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-13">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-14">Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-16">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-17">Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. {in the...: Heb. in the eyes of every thing that hath a wing}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-18">And they lay wait for their {own} blood; they lurk privily for their {own} lives.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-19">So {are} the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; {which} taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-20">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: {Wisdom: Heb. Wisdoms, that is, Excellent wisdom}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, {saying},</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-23">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-24">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-27">When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-28">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-29">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-30">They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-32">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. {turning...: or, ease of the simple}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-1-p-33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>
<h2 id="prv-ch-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-2">So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, {and} apply thine heart to understanding;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-3">Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, {and} liftest up thy voice for understanding; {liftest...: Heb. givest thy voice}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-4">If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as {for} hid treasures;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-6">For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth {cometh} knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: {he is} a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-8">He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; {yea}, every good path.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-10">When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-11">Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-12">To deliver thee from the way of the evil {man}, from the man that speaketh froward things;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-13">Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-14">Who rejoice to do evil, {and} delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-15">Whose ways {are} crooked, and {they} froward in their paths:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, {even} from the stranger {which} flattereth with her words;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-17">Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-18">For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-19">None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good {men}, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-2-p-22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. {rooted: or, plucked up}</p>
<h2 id="prv-ch-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-1">My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-2">For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. {long...: Heb. years of life}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-3">Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-4">So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. {good...: or, good success}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-5">Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-6">In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-7">Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-8">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. {health: Heb. medicine} {marrow: Heb. watering, or, moistening}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-9">Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-10">So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-11">My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-12">For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son {in whom} he delighteth.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-13">Happy {is} the man {that} findeth wisdom, and the man {that} getteth understanding. {that getteth...: Heb. that draweth out understanding}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-14">For the merchandise of it {is} better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-15">She {is} more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-16">Length of days {is} in her right hand; {and} in her left hand riches and honour.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-17">Her ways {are} ways of pleasantness, and all her paths {are} peace.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-18">She {is} a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy {is every one} that retaineth her.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-19">The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. {established: or, prepared}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-20">By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-21">My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-22">So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-24">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-26">For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do {it}. {them...: Heb. the owners thereof}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-28">Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-29">Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. {Devise...: or, Practise no evil}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-30">Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-31">Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. {the oppressor: Heb. a man of violence}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-32">For the froward {is} abomination to the LORD: but his secret {is} with the righteous.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-33">The curse of the LORD {is} in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-34">Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-3-p-35">The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools. {shall be...: Heb. exalteth the fools}</p>
<h2 id="prv-ch-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-1">Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-2">For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-3">For I was my father's son, tender and only {beloved} in the sight of my mother.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-4">He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-5">Get wisdom, get understanding: forget {it} not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-6">Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-7">Wisdom {is} the principal thing; {therefore} get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-8">Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-9">She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. {a crown...: or, she shall compass thee with a crown of glory}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-10">Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-11">I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-12">When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-13">Take fast hold of instruction; let {her} not go: keep her; for she {is} thy life.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-14">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil {men}.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-15">Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-16">For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause {some} to fall.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-17">For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-18">But the path of the just {is} as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-19">The way of the wicked {is} as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-20">My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-21">Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-22">For they {are} life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. {health: Heb. medicine}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-23">Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it {are} the issues of life. {with...: Heb. above all keeping}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-24">Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. {a froward...: Heb. frowardness of mouth and perverseness of lips}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-25">Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-26">Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. {let...: or, all thy ways shall be ordered aright}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-4-p-27">Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</p>
<h2 id="prv-ch-5">Chapter 5</h2>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-1">My son, attend unto my wisdom, {and} bow thine ear to my understanding:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-2">That thou mayest regard discretion, and {that} thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-3">For the lips of a strange woman drop {as} an honeycomb, and her mouth {is} smoother than oil: {mouth: Heb. palate}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-6">Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, {that} thou canst not know {them}.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-7">Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-9">Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-10">Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours {be} in the house of a stranger; {thy wealth: Heb. thy strength}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-11">And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-12">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-13">And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-14">I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-16">Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, {and} rivers of waters in the streets.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-17">Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-18">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-19">{Let her be as} the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. {satisfy...: Heb. water thee} {be thou...: Heb. err thou always in her love}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-20">And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-21">For the ways of man {are} before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. {sins: Heb. sin}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-5-p-23">He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
<h2 id="prv-ch-6">Chapter 6</h2>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-1">My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, {if} thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. {and make...: or, so shalt thou prevail with thy friend}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand {of the hunter}, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-7">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-8">Provideth her meat in the summer, {and} gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-10">{Yet} a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-11">So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-12">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-13">He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-14">Frowardness {is} in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. {soweth: Heb. casteth forth}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-16">These six {things} doth the LORD hate: yea, seven {are} an abomination unto him: {unto...: Heb. of his soul}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-17">A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, {A proud...: Heb. Haughty eyes}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-18">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-19">A false witness {that} speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-20">My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-21">Bind them continually upon thine heart, {and} tie them about thy neck.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-22">When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and {when} thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-23">For the commandment {is} a lamp; and the law {is} light; and reproofs of instruction {are} the way of life: {lamp: or, candle}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-24">To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. {of the...: or, of the strange tongue}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-25">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-26">For by means of a whorish woman {a man is brought} to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. {the adulteress: Heb. the woman of a man, or, a man's wife}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-28">Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-29">So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-30">{Men} do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-31">But {if} he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-32">{But} whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he {that} doeth it destroyeth his own soul. {understanding: Heb. heart}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-33">A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-34">For jealousy {is} the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-6-p-35">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. {He will...: Heb. He will not accept the face of any ransom}</p>
<h2 id="prv-ch-7">Chapter 7</h2>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-2">Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-3">Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-4">Say unto wisdom, Thou {art} my sister; and call understanding {thy} kinswoman:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger {which} flattereth with her words.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-6">For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-7">And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, {the youths: Heb. the sons}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-8">Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-9">In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: {in the evening: Heb. in the evening of days}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-10">And, behold, there met him a woman {with} the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-11">(She {is} loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-12">Now {is she} without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-13">So she caught him, and kissed him, {and} with an impudent face said unto him, {with...: Heb. she strengthened her face and said}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-14">{I have} peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. {I have...: Heb. Peace offerings are upon me}</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-16">I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved {works}, with fine linen of Egypt.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p id="prv-ch-7-p-18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>
