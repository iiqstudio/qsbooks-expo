    <h1 id="3jo">3 John</h1>
<h2 id="3jo-ch-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-1">The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth. {in...: or, truly}</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-2">Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. {wish: or, pray}</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-3">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-4">I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-5">Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-6">Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: {after...: Gr. worthy of God}</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-7">Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-8">We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth. {fellowhelpers: or, joint-labourers}</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-9">I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-10">Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth {them} out of the church.</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-11">Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-12">Demetrius hath good report of all {men}, and of the truth itself: yea, and we {also} bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-13">I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-14">But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.</p>
<p id="3jo-ch-1-p-15">Peace {be} to thee. {Our} friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name. {face to...: Gr. mouth to mouth}</p>
